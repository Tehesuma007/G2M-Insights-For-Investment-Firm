## 4. Data Exploration

### Insights

- Distribution of trip distances indicates higher frequency of shorter trips.
- Urban cities generate significantly higher revenue compared to rural areas.
- Seasonal trends observed in transaction amounts.

### Key Questions

- What is the average transaction amount across city types?
- How does customer retention vary by city?

## 5. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

### Steps Taken

1. Missing values handled by imputation or removal.
2. Outliers identified and treated for key numerical variables.
3. New features created, e.g., `Revenue per KM`.

## 6. Statistical Analysis

### Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation.
- Inferential statistics: T-tests.

### Key Findings

- Significant differences in revenue between city types.
- Transaction amounts vary with seasonality.

## 7. Data Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Revenue comparison by city type.
- **Line Graphs**: Seasonal trends in transaction amounts.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationship between trip distance and revenue.

## 8. Hypothesis Testing

### Example Hypotheses

1. **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no difference in average transaction amounts across city types.
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference in average transaction amounts across city types.

### Results

- P-value < 0.05 for city type analysis, rejecting H0 and indicating significant differences.

## 9. Recommendations

1. Focus investments on urban areas due to higher revenue potential.
2. Develop targeted marketing campaigns for high-retention customers.
3. Optimize pricing strategies to align with seasonal demand.
